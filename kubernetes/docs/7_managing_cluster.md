There are two ways to manage the K8s cluster in AWS, with KOPS and EKS. KOPS is a tool that helps you manage production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters. EKS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes clusters.

## KOPS Pros

- KOPS is a tool that helps you manage production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters.
- KOPS is a command-line tool that helps you create, destroy, upgrade, and maintain production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters from the command line.
- It is well respected and heabvily used in the community.
- KOPS is a good choice if you want to manage your own Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
- Kops is easy to use and has a lot of features that make it easy to manage your Kubernetes cluster.

## KOPS Cons
- You are responsible for managing your Master and Worker nodes.
- By default you only get a single master node, which is a single point of failure.
- You have to manage the etcd cluster yourself.
- It feels like more work than EKS but it's mostly because you have more control over the cluster.

But KOPS is really the realiable old work horse. 

## EKS Pros
